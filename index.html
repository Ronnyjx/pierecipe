    <p>This homemade pumpkin pie made with mashed, cooked pumpkin is my family's favorite. Skip the
        canned pumpkin and store-bought crust and make your holiday pumpkin pie from scratch with a flaky
        homemade pastry crust and a deliciously spiced pumpkin filling. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family
        does!

    <h1>How To Prepare it?</h1>
    <h3><i>Directions step by step:</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender
            until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is
            moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a
            thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut
            a circle of dough 1 1/2 inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set
            pie pan aside.
        </li>
        <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan.
            Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top
            edges.
        </li>
        <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger,
            nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared
            crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out
            clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling
            cooks.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><i>Directions to prepare the mashed pumpkin:</i></h3>
    <p>Cut a fresh pie pumpkin in half. Scoop out and discard seeds and stringy portions. Leave skin on and cut
        pumpkin into chunks. Measure out 1 1/2 pounds for this recipe to yield 2 cups of mashed, cooked pumpkin.
        If your pumpkin is larger, consider cooking 3 pounds and doubling the pie recipe above to make two pies.
    </p>
    <p>Place pumpkin chunks in saucepan over medium heat with 1 inch water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat
        to low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove and discard peel.
        Return pumpkin to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill until smooth.
